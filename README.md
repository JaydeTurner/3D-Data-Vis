# 3D-Data-Vis
coursework completed in final year of university in Java to visualise data provided on a CSV file

this was created in the software called "Processing" which is a development environment for working with data and does some of the clean up to allow me to focus on the guts of the code rather than the surrounding setup required.

Processing can be downloaded here:

If running the pre built executable found in the zip file Open JDK 17 is a prerequisite to installation.
